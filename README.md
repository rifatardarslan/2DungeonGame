## 🧩 About the Project
**2Dungeon Game** is a 3D dungeon crawler built entirely in **Unreal Engine 5** using **Blueprints**.  
Players explore procedurally designed levels, fight monsters, collect loot, and try to survive through increasingly challenging dungeons.

🧠 **Core Concept:**  
A hybrid between classic dungeon adventures and modern roguelike gameplay — each dungeon run feels unique thanks to randomized layouts and enemy spawns.
